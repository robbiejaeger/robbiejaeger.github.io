title: Using Ruby Enumerations From a MATLAB Background

<p>I recently enrolled in the Turing School in Denver, CO for full-stack web development, and I have been learning the Ruby language
  ever since! Before Turing, I was working as a technical writer for MathWorks, the company who developed the MATLAB language. Even before
  MathWorks, I was using MATLAB to process data in graduate school, and I really enjoyed using it for engineering and data processing.</p>

<p>One of the major differences in functionality between MATLAB and Ruby is enumerations - Ruby has them, MATLAB doesn't.</p>

<p>Enumerations are features in Ruby that intend to replace tradiational <em>for</em> loops with statements that are simpler, more
  readable, and elegant. As a starting points, let's look at an example MATLAB script with a for loop for calculating the sum of
  the first 10 integers.</p>

<p>n = 10;
s = 0;
for i=1:n
s = s + i;
end</p>

<p>One issue of this loop is the index, i, which is now a global variable in the script and resides in the MATLAB base workspace. If you are
  not careful and reuse i for another for loop later in the script, your indexing can have unexpected behavior. To get around this, you can
  limit the scope by placing the loop inside a function, but this can be cumbersome. In Ruby, there is no need to keep track of an index
  variable.</p>

<p>It is also a common practice in to initialize the sum variable before the for loop executes. In Ruby, you do not need to initialize
  this variable.</p>

<p>And now for the main event!</p>
