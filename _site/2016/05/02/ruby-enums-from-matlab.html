<h1>Using Ruby Enumerations From a MATLAB Background</h1>
<p>May 02, 2016</p>
<p>I recently enrolled in the Turing School in Denver, CO for full-stack web development, and I have been learning the Ruby language
  ever since! Before Turing, I was working as a technical writer for MathWorks, the company who developed the MATLAB language. Even before
  MathWorks, I was using MATLAB to process data in graduate school, and I really enjoyed using it for engineering and data processing.</p>

<p>One of the major differences in functionality between MATLAB and Ruby is enumerations - Ruby has them, MATLAB doesn't.</p>

<p>Enumerations are features in Ruby that intend to replace tradiational <em>for</em> loops with statements that are simpler, more
  readable, and elegant. As a starting points, let's look at an example MATLAB script with a for loop for calculating the sum of
  the first 10 integers multiplied by two.</p>

<p>n = 10;
s = 0;
for i=1:n
s = s + i*2;
end</p>

<p>One issue of this loop is the index, i, which is now a global variable in the script and resides in the MATLAB base workspace. If you are
  not careful and reuse i for another for loop later in the script, your indexing can have unexpected behavior. To get around this, you can
  limit the scope by placing the loop inside a function, but this can be cumbersome. In Ruby, there is no need to keep track of an index
  variable.</p>

<p>It is also a common practice in to initialize a variable for summation before the for loop executes. In Ruby, you do not need to initialize
  this variable.</p>

<p>Now that we know some of these MATLAB qualities, it's time for the main event: map! There are many enumerations in Ruby, but map
  is an easy one to start with, and it's still very powerful. Let's do the same thing from the MATLAB script using Ruby.</p>

<p>(1..10).to_a.map{|num| num*2}.reduce(:+)</p>

<p>One line!</p>
