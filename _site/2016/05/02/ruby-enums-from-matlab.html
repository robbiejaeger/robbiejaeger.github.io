<h1>Coming From MATLAB, How To Ruby</h1>
<p id="post-date">May 02, 2016</p>
<p>I recently enrolled in the Turing School in Denver, CO for full-stack web development, and I've been learning the Ruby language
  for just a few weeks. Before Turing, I was working as a technical writer for MathWorks, the company who developed the MATLAB language.
  Even before MathWorks, I was using MATLAB to process data in graduate school, and I really enjoyed using it for engineering and
  data processing.</p>

<p>One of the major differences in functionality between MATLAB and Ruby is enumerations - Ruby has them, MATLAB doesn't.</p>

<p>Enumerations are features in Ruby that intend to replace tradiational <em>for</em> loops with statements that are simpler, more
  readable, and elegant. As a starting points, let's look at an example MATLAB script with a for loop for calculating the sum of
  the first 10 integers multiplied by two.</p>

<code>n = 10; <br> s = 0; <br> for i=1:n <br> s = s + i*2; <br> end</code>

<p>One issue of this loop is the index, i, which is now a global variable in the script and resides in the MATLAB base workspace.
  If you are not careful and reuse i for another for loop later in the script, your indexing can have unexpected behavior. To get
  around this, you can limit the scope by placing the loop inside a function, but this can be cumbersome. In Ruby, there is no need
  to keep track of an index variable.</p>

<p>It is also a common practice in to initialize a variable for summation before the for loop executes. In Ruby, you do not need to
  initialize this variable.</p>

<p>Now that we know some of these MATLAB qualities, it's time for the main event: map! There are many enumerations in Ruby, but map
  is an easy one to start with, and it's still very powerful. Let's do the same thing from the MATLAB script using Ruby.</p>

<code>(1..10).to_a.map{|num| num*2}.reduce(:+)</code>

<p>One line! After years of writing MATLAB scripts, it was hard for me to shake off old MATLAB habits and use enumerables in this way.
  Let's go through each chunck of the code and what each returns.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>(1..10)</code> - returns a range object of numbers from 1 through 10</li>
  <li><code>to_a</code> - returns an array from the range object: <code>[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]</code></li>
  <li><code>map{|num| num*2}</code> - each number in the array is multiplied by two, then map returns the new multiplied array:
    <code>[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]</code></li>
  <li><code>reduce(:+)</code> - sums the elements of the array</li>
</ul>

<p>Strung all together, the one line of code returns 110, as expected. There is an even shorter way to find the sum using only reduce
  instead of map, but we can save that for another day.</p>
